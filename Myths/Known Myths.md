### Known Myths


The following stuff are a myths when it comes to gaming or Windows 10 in general.

* [NTFS tunnelling](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050715-14/?p=34923) tweak: Reducing the default value (1024) for `MaximumTunnelEntries` entry which reduces the [NTFS tunnel cache](https://windowsir.blogspot.com/2014/07/file-system-ops-effects-on-mft-records.html) helps to improve the deletation performance for directories that contain a large number of files. 
* Enabling the [NtfsDisableLastAccessUpdate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/fsutil-behavior) registry value helps to improve e.g. backup job performance. This is a myth and the [entry has changed across multiple Windows versions](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/ntfs-disable-last-access-update-file-time-stamp-windows-10-april-1803-update.421228/). NtfsDisableLastAccessUpdate is only enabled during boot sequence for system drives on a SSD with 128 GB or less. [Windows 10 itself disables the NtfsDisableLastAccessUpdate entry](https://www.hecfblog.com/2018/12/daily-blog-557-changes-in.html) on bigger system drives. If the default state is activated (system managed) the NTFS/ReFS drive (if you use others like FAT this doesn't matter at all), the last access is activated during boot whenever a system volume is in use and mounted. There is a limitation which says it's only in use if you use 128 GB or less. If you use larger system partitions then the updates are disabled. You do not need to change anything on this entry. Starting with Windows 10 1809/1903 setting the value manually via fsutil will be ignored.
* [Firmware updates are bad](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/3_Dick_PHOENIX_attack%20surface%20risks.pdf): This is not anymore the case, there are certain checks when you use [UEFI](https://uefi.org/faq) to ensure that you don't install a faulty update. [Windows 8 (2012) used an update mechanism](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/windows-uefi-firmware-update-platform) that delivers update packages to a known system location, the UEFI firmware then installs the update package on its own, after a restart which causes some problems (BSOD/performance regressions in some cases etc). Since Windows 10 a lot has [changed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/installing-the-update), the UEFI updates are more reliable and it's overall spoken worth checking the manufacturer's support site for firmware updates, which not only improve your security it also can fix several regressions regarding [performance](https://www.technorms.com/64686/firmware-update-improve-device-performace). The [best pracice](https://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI%20Firmware%20-%20Security%20Concerns%20and%20Best%20Practices%209.13.17.pdf) is to review the update, check the changelog and decide if you _need_ it or not, before you update make a backup and then install the update. 
* Enabling [Game Mode](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028293/windows-using-game-mode-on-your-pc) will cause stuttering and performance problems - No, not anymore. MS changed a lot since Windows Build 1803+. This was finally fixed and the application should now get the resource it needs e.g. for encoding (OBS Studio). If there are game related issue then it's not caused by an enabled Game Mode. The mode indeed checks if the game is supported or not. On Laptop systems game mode will not work no matter if you set it to on or off, this is by design and not a bug.
* Disable Drive Indexing (Windows Search) should be turned off. Myth, because [reading I/O doesn't decrease your SSD lifespan](http://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead) - writing on it does! However if you don't like Windows own Search you could use [Void's Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/).
* Configure “Defragment and Optimize your device” - useless, because Windows since 8+ can handle it on his own, it detects if you're on SSD or HDD and defrag it or not, disabling the service schedule does nothing because it runs anyway (for several other operations).
* Set your SATA controller to AHCI mode for Solid State Drives SSD - This is not necessary, Windows detects it automatically based on your BIOS/UEFI settings.
* [Pagefile (page file/ paging file) Managing](https://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-educates-insiders-windows-10-handles-memory), disable it because it _constantly_ writes on your SSD - Yes, it writes important things on your SSD but some applications and games might crash if you entirely disable it. Leave it on "Automatically manage paging file size for all drives". It's possible to envision edge cases where tweaking the page file makes sense, but those examples are vanishingly rare.
* Disabling Windows own restore Point feature - It's more up to you, this can be important in case shit happened but it does not affect the performance because Windows only creates automatic restore points whenever you install/uninstall prigrams which supporting this function, manually or on a schedule which checks if you're CPU is busy right now (over 45%).
* Disable Hibernate - It's also up to everyone to use it or not, in you you want to turn it off: powercfg -h off
* Disable SuperFetch - Not necessary because since Windows 8 it's detected by Windows. It's running but it does nothing when you're on a SSD. You can check it's state via `fsutil behavior query DisableDeleteNotify` which should be 0. This means TRIM is enabled.
* [NIC System.ini IRQ Tweak](https://www.speedguide.net/articles/systemini-irq-tweak-168)
* [System Responsiveness](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684247.aspx). It doesn't need to be tweaked.
* Disabling C states in BIOS [improves SSD performance](https://www.overclock.net/forum/5-intel-cpus/1333701-intel-c-states-off-better-ssd-performance.html). [As for the SSD](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ssd-hdd-power,2170-3.html), the amount of writes is reduced without hibernation. When a computer hibernates, the contents of the RAM is dumped to the hibernate file on the C drive, which is the SSD in this case. Since SSDs have a finite amount of writes and there can be a lot of stuff in the RAM, you can see how this is a problem. The contents of RAM are being paged to the C drive constantly, anyways. The amount of extra SSD I/O due to hibernation is trivial compared to loading a game with let's say 20GB of textures and levels.
* Disabling Windows animations - This is not helpful at all, since all animations are GPU accelerated. A gaming machine should have a graphics card capable of running them without any problem Windows 10 requires a "powerful" enough GPU system.
* Disable High Precision Event Timer (HPET) is not needed after Windows April Update (Build 1803) you can check the current status via `bcdedit /enum`.
* Encrypting the OS partition (whole OS) affects gaming performance - This is incorrect, all modern hardware supports AES-256 via hardware level which means it will not affect your gaming performance, howver the loading times _could be a bit slower_ because the backend VeraCrypt/TrueCrypt have to decode the data before your game reads it.
* [Disable Nagle’s Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm) - This is not needed, [Windows 10 already chooses the best algorithm](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/214397/design-issues-sending-small-data-segments-over-tcp-with-winsock)  based what your network driver supports. Which means even if you change something in the registry which is not supported by the OS/Driver you won't get any benefit out of it.
* Turn on ReadyBoost - Pagefile on SSD (especially on other partition than game) definitely outperforms ReadyBoost, the service will be unavailable on systems with SSD. If it's there than you use an outdated OS (or it's a bug).
* CPU core affinity performance/fps fixes - [See here](https://old.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/5z1ndx/cpu_core_affinity_performancefps_fix/deupoqf/) for an explanation.
